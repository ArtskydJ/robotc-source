How to program autonomous routines:


----- How to drive -----
L = -Left/Type- column
R = -Rht/Spd- column

To drive a certain speed, input:
	T | SPD
	L | speed
	R | speed

To drive a certain distance, input:
	T | ENC
	L | encoder distance
	R | encoder distance

To keep straight with gyro, input:
	T | STR
	L | target gyro
	R | target distance

To follow a line, input:
	T | LINEC
	L | speed
	R |   -
	
To turn with the gyro, input:
	T | GYRO2
	L | target rotation
	R | target speed
	
To turn left wheels with the gyro, input:
	T | GYROL
	L | target rotation
	R | target speed
	
To turn right wheels with the gyro, input:
	T | GYROR
	L | target rotation
	R | target speed


----- How to do other things -----
LIFT |			Input speed or height into the -Lift- column
INTAKE |		Input speed into the -Intake- column
SKIP TO STEP |	Input wanted step into the -Action- column of RESET_AUTO
